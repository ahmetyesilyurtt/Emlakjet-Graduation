### Considerations During the Writing of the Project

- It has been tried to make sure that the code is clean, understandable and easy to read.
- It has been tried to be written in accordance with the code structure. It was created taking into account the layered architecture. 
- This project has been tried to be done in accordance with the microservice architecture.
- Exception Handling have been tried to be used.
- Programming principles (SOLID etc.) were tried to be taken into account.


### Future Work

- Logging and Exception Handling can be diversified to make them more inclusive across the whole code.
- Logging operations written to a file or database.
- Instead of using a common database, each service can be connecting to its own database to be more secure.
- Design patterns can be used.
- The unit test should be developed by writing new tests for all services and all cases of these services' methods.
- A suitable frontend can be written.
